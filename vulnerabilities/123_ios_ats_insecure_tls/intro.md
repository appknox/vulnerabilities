The "NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion" key is part of the App Transport Security (ATS)
configuration in iOS apps. This key allows you to specify the minimum version of
the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that ATS should use when making secure
network connections. By setting a minimum TLS version, it can ensured that the app
communicates with servers using a secure and up-to-date protocol.
