Data in transit or at rest needs to be secured from exposure using proper access controls and
cryptography. Sometimes, even if cryptography is in place, it may not be sufficient as many
application still use weak cryptographic algorithms or vulnerable hash algorithms to protect
sensitive data. The application APIs can also reveal sensitive information if proper access
controls are not kept in place revealing sensitive information to outside world. Also, many
applications leave the sensitive directories open publicly which may reveal lot of sensitive
information including internal software versions, passwords, internal IPs etc.
