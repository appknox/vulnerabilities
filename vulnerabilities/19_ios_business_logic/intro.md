Most security problems are weaknesses in an application that result from
a broken or missing security control (authentication, access control,
input validation, etc.). By contrast, business logic vulnerabilities are
ways of using the legitimate processing flow of an application in a way
that results in a negative consequence to the organization.

Too often, the business logic category is used for vulnerabilities that
can't be scanned for automatically. This makes it very difficult to
apply any kind of categorization scheme. Business logic problems are
different from authentication problems and every other category. There
are many significant business logic vulnerabilities, but they are far
less common than the type of items.
