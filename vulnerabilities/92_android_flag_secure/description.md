Protect sensitive windows within the app by enabling the `FLAG_SECURE` flag. This flag protect app windows from non-secure screen recording done by any 3rd-party app and also prevent users from taking screenshots (by pressing VOLUME DOWN + POWER buttons). Such screenshots are stored on the SDCard by default which is accessible to all apps, thus sensitive data may be exposed.
