We used following approaches to check if the OTP could be bypassed:

- Check if the generated OTP can be re-generated by breaking into the logic of how an OTP is generated
- Check if the OTP challenge is present in the client side, which includes in response body or stored in filesystem layer or in the memory layer
- Check if an older OTP can be re-used again in the future transaction
- Check the randomness of the OTP
- Check if the OTP could be brute-forced by requesting wrong OTP until a correct OTP can be verified
- Check the expiry time of a generated OTP
- Check the number of wrong attempts accepted to verify an OTP
