Domain whitelisting is a security model that controls access to external
domains over which an application has no control. Cordova provides a
configurable security policy to define which external sites may be
accessed. By default, new apps are configured to allow
access to any site. Before moving the application to production, one should
formulate a whitelist and allow access to specific network domains and subdomains.
