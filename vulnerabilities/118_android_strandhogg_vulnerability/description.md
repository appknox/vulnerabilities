  
One or more than one public facing activities of the application is
vulnerable to StandHogg vulnerability.
  
  
  
In StrandHogg and regular task hijacking, malicious applications typically
deploy one of the following techniques or a selection in tandem:
  
  
  
- **Task Affinity Manipulation**: The malicious application leverages two activities, M1 and M2, wherein M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app and M2.allowTaskReparenting = true. In the eventuality that the malicious app is opened on M2, M2 would be relocated to the front and the user will interact with the malicious application once the victim application has initiated.
  
  
  
- **Single Task Mode**: In the eventuality that the victim application sets launchMode to singleTask, malicious applications can leverage M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app to hijack the victim's application task stack.
  
  
  
- **Task Reparenting**: In the eventuality that the victim application sets taskReparenting to true, malicious applications can move the victim's application task to the malicious application's stack.
  
  
  
However, in the case of StrandHogg 2.0, all exported activities without a launchMode
of singleTask or singleInstance are affected on vulnerable Android versions.
