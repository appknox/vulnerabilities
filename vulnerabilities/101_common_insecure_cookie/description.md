"HTTPOnly" cookies cannot be read by client-side scripts, therefore marking a cookie as HTTPOnly can provide an additional layer of protection against cookie stealing through cross-site scripting attacks.
"Secure" cookies are sent only over HTTPS connections hence any browsers which support the secure flag will only send cookies with the secure flag when the request is going to a HTTPS page preventing the cookies from being observed by unauthorized parties.
