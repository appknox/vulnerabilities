CRIME is a security exploit against secret web cookies over connections using the
HTTPS and SPDY protocols that also use data compression. When used to recover the
content of secret authentication cookies, it allows an attacker to perform session
hijacking on an authenticated web session, allowing the launching of further attacks.
