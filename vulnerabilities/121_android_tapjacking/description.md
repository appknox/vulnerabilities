Android tapjacking is a type of attack where an attacker tricks or deceives a user into tapping on a seemingly harmless element on their Android device's screen, while secretly performing malicious actions in the background. Cybercriminals deploy overlay attacks to steal victimsâ€™ login credentials, bank card details, and other confidential information.
