The "NSAllowsLocalNetworking" key is part of the App Transport Security (ATS) configuration
in iOS apps. This key was introduced to allow apps to interact with local network resources
without being subject to the same level of security requirements as external network resources.
This key provides a way to control whether ATS rules should apply to local network connections,
such as connections to localhost or other devices on the same local network.
