    Android APK Reverse Engineering Suite (Decompiler, Editor, Debugger
    & More)
  - [CFR](http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/) - Another Java decompiler
  - [JDGui](http://jd.benow.ca/) - Yet another fast Java decompiler
  - [Fernflower](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower) - An analytical
    decompiler for Java
