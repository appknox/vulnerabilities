Java source code is typically compiled into Java bytecode â€“ the instruction set of the Java virtual machine.
The compiled Java bytecode can be easily reversed engineered back into source
code by freely available decompilers. Bytecode Obfuscation is the process of modifying
Java bytecode (executable or library) so that it is much harder to read and understand
for a hacker but remains fully functional.
