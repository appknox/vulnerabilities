Generally, all mobile code is susceptible to reverse engineering. Some apps are more susceptible than others. Code written in languages / frameworks that allow for dynamic introspection at runtime (Java, .NET, Objective C, Swift) are particularly at risk for reverse engineering. Detecting susceptibility to reverse engineering is fairly straight forward. First, decrypt the app store version of the app (if binary encryption is applied). Code will be susceptible if it is fairly easy to understand the app’s controlflow path, string table, and any pseudocode/source-code generated by these tools.

Bytecode obfuscation consists of multiple complementary techniques
that can help create a layered defense against reverse engineering and
tampering. Some typical examples of obfuscation techniques include:

Renaming to alter the name of methods and variables to make
the decompiled source much harder for a human to understand.
Control Flow Obfuscationcreates conditional, branching, and
iterative constructs that produce valid executable logic, but yield
non-deterministic semantic results when decompiled.
String Encryption hides strings in the executable and only
restores their original value when needed
Instruction Pattern Transformation converts common
instructions to other, less obvious constructs potential confusing
decompliers.
Dummy Code Insertion inserts code that does not affect the
program’s logic, but breaks decompilers or makes reverse-engineered
code harder to analyze.
Unused Code and Metadata Removal prunes out debug,
non-essential metadata and used code from applications to reduce the
information available to an attacker.
